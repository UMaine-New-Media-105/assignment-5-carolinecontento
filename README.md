I also created in the draw function a loop so that when the kelp collides with the crab then it becomes eaten.

I also was having issues on how to figure out how to switch the height of the crab when it hit the end of the canvas.
I also was having them spwan everywhere. I wanted to submit simething instead of nothing.

This assignment I was about to have the kelp be eaten more slowly which is in the set up function.
added myCatcher.push(catcher); in the set up function
